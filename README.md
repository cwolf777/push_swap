📦 push_swap
This repository contains a solution to the push_swap project from the **third circle** of the **42 school curriculum**.
It focuses on algorithm design, data structures, and efficient sorting under strict operational constraints.

🚀 Project Overview
The goal of push_swap is to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations and two stacks — A and B.
The challenge lies in producing the most efficient sorting sequence possible (i.e., with the fewest operations).

This implementation includes:

🔁 Custom sorting algorithm inspired by the [Turk Algorithm](https://medium.com/@ayogun/push-swap-c1f5d2d41e97)

📦 Custom linked list structures to represent stacks

🧠 Cost-based decision logic to find the "cheapest" moves

🛠️ Reused core library components via a modular libft repository
